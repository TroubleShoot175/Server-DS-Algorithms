# Server-DS-Algorithms
## Overview
This is a repository of all algorithms I learned from my Data Science Course.

Each one of algorithms implemented in Python and are intended for use for operations provided by my web server.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Elbow Method
This algorithm is intended to figure out the best number of clusters for a given dataset by using a Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) value.

### K-means Clustering
This algorithm is one of many ways to cluster given data.

### DB Scan

### Hierarchical Cluster 

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
